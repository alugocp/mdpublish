# Publisher
This is a small tool to render markdown files into websites that can be hosted online.
Use it for easily publishing your digital journals or project ideas.

## Todo
### Basic Start Point
- [x] Make sure you can convert a markdown file to HTML
- [x] Add support for recursive file directories
- [ ] Make sure links work as expected
- [ ] Structure the tool as a simple CLI with I/O directory args

### Cleaning It Up
- [ ] Restructure the code to feel better and be more organized/robust
- [ ] Add a linter to the project
- [ ] Validate arguments and all paths with regex
- [ ] Throw some logging in there
- [ ] Read `.gitignore` files and ignore the paths within
- [ ] Allow the tool to apply a stylesheet to the generated sites
- [ ] Add a configuration file (`yaml`) to help with fine details
- [ ] Test the installation and add info here
